Hi there 👋 I'm **mobile app developer** using Android. 🚀  
I use Android native, but currently learning cross-platform developing like Flutter.  
I am a senior student of Seoul Women's Univercity, and will graduate in Febuary 2024.  
With majored in Degital Media(program developing) and Chemistry, I have experiences in many science fields.  
At present, I'm studying different platforms and languages on my own.

I enjoy watching musicals, writing and reading. 🎟️🖋️🔖  
I hope to develop life-enhancing services. 🌟
